# GitTrack
* A GitHub user commit tracker and does more than track commits. It tracks new projects/repos too! B.T.W you can't get the PAT from other people unless you have permission. DISCLAMER: This JavaScript Web Plugin (JSWP) will not do any insecure transactions or any programillactily bad transactions that will steal personal info, sensitive info e.g. passwords, emails, PIN codes, phone numbers, and credit card numbers. 
* This works by getting a GitHub PAT (Personal Accsess Token). To get one, go to your account settings and search "Personal accsess tokens" and then generate a new PAT and then download this repo and edit the GitTrack.js file.
* Edit the PAT string value and delete the old PAT value, then paste your PAT into the value.
